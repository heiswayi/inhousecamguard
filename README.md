### Inhouse Camguard - Live Video Motion Detection Analysis & Data Logging

Few months ago, I built Inhouse Camguard in my spare time to experiment with some AForge libraries using C# and WPF. AForge.NET Framework is easy to use and we can do many great applications with it. Other than just detecting motion in the live video feed, Inhouse Camguard also can plot a continuous graph showing the sensivity of the motion from the camera source, do data logging with some options and capture the image based on trigger threshold.
